# Codeworks Pre Course

This pre course is important, because it allows all students in a class to have a solid common ground when the main course starts. Understanding the theory part and solving the exercises included here is required for you to proceed to the main course.

Be aware that not completing this material leads to rescheduling or canceling your main course.

### Communications

You should have received an invite to the Codeworks Slack team (if not, please let us know by email). Make sure you keep the [Slack](https://slack.com/) app installed on your mobile phone (logged in, with notifications turned on), as from this point onwards we might use this channel to communicate instead of email, for anything that is time-sensitive or benefits from a group conversation.

Because we operate in different time zones, some channels can have messages posted at any time of the day or night. To avoid being disturbed while you sleep, we suggest to set your phone on silent or airplane mode, or simply [snooze all Slack notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/218551977-Reduce-noise-in-Slack#do-not-disturb) for the time needed.

### Equipment

To attend the course you need a laptop computer, with camera, mic, and speakers, to allow video calls and participate in live lectures.

If you signed up for an on-site course, you also need to bring a pair of noise-isolating or noise-cancelling earphones or headphones, with microphone. If they are battery-powered, make sure they can last for at least two hours.

In case you want to buy new equipment, as a Codeworks on-site student you are entitled to [Apple discounts for Education](https://github.com/codeworks/students-handbook/wiki/Discounts).

### Software

For starters, you need to have the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/support/download) installed on your computer.

As you progress throughout this course you will be required to install other software.

## Course structure

The pre course material is divided in two main parts: theory and exercises (as respectively described in the `theory.md`, and `exercises.md` files). We suggest you to start with theory sections from 1 to 6, and then do the exercises while you complete theory sections 7 and 8 on the side.

## Study tips

If a concept is not clear, look for extra information online (videos, tutorials, blogs, forums, etc). Also, consider sleeping over it and tackle it again the next day: you’ll notice that in the meantime your brain keeps elaborating information in the background.

Another important resource is Slack: use it to interact with other students and get unstuck. Instructors follow the conversation, and will help when needed.

After having taken the above steps, make sure you keep a written list of anything that you still want to clarify, so you can discuss it with instructors during the support sessions.

Finally, in case you find any bugs, broken links, typos, outdated info, or have feedback on how to improve this curriculum please shoot an email to “<instructors@codeworks.me>”, so we can keep making it better.

### Extra credits

After you have completed all theory and exercises, if you have time left to study before joining the main course, feel free to challenge yourself with the “extra credits” sections.

These sections are not mandatory, and can take a long time to complete, but offer a sneak peek into some topics that will be covered during the main course.

## Ready, set, go!

Ok, now you should be ready to start digging into `theory.md`
