# Codeworks Pre Course Theory

This is the theory part of the Codeworks pre course curriculum.

The order in which topics are presented has a meaning, although it’s not completely strict. Some students prefer to tackle a couple topics together, switching between them as they progress, while others prefer to focus on one subject at a time. Find what works best for you.

Next to each section we indicate an estimate of how many hours should be approximately required to complete it. Depending on your familiarity with the topic, it can take more or less time: don’t worry about it, just make sure you understand the subject well.

## 1. Become an editor guru (5 hrs)

A text editor is to coders what a brush is to painters. If you master how to use it, everything becomes easier. To start, pick an editor you like and dig into its functionality, explore all the menus and learn important keyboard shortcuts by heart.

Here’s a brief list of the most popular editors out there:

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

We mention Vim and Emacs first, because they’ve been around for a very long time. Also, Vim is installed by default on all Unix systems and most Linux editions. Having said this, both editors are powerful but not particularly user-friendly at the beginning.

Atom, Visual Studio, and Sublime Text are great editors to get started.

During the course we’re going to use VS Code: [install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on your computer and add the [Live Share plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare).

Make sure to master your editor and become very comfortable writing code without having to take your hands off the keyboard most of the time. In particular, learn how to:

- Move the cursor, or select text, by increments of words and entire lines
- Increase and decrease indentation for blocks of code
- Use syntax highlighting and a code linter
- Comment and un-comment code
- Use auto-completion
- Quickly execute the code you’re editing (i.e. “build”)
- Use advanced search, and substitute multiple string matches at the same time
- Customize the graphical aspect of your code editor (color scheme, font, etc.)

You can find an intro to these topics and more advanced ones though [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks).

## 2. Get familiar with online documentation (2 hrs)

Software engineers need to find information online all the time. Nobody remembers every function signature and method name by heart: it’s impossible. Online docs provide an always up-to-date resource, and the developers’ community is there to help.

In particular, there are 3 online resources for JavaScript that should become second nature to you:

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)

Take some time to explore these platforms and become very familiar with them: every piece of information you find there will follow a consistent format.

For example, if you don’t remember how the `Array.splice()` method works, you just need to google “mdn array splice“, and read the docs. If you have doubts regarding a coding problem, you can look for answers on Stack Overflow or ask a new question there. If you don’t know a jQuery method signature, google it and check a code example.

## 3. Learn how to use the Chrome developer tools (8 hrs)

The developer tools are a great way to inspect and debug your web apps, besides helping you understand how the JavaScript interpreter works and how the code you write is executed.

To learn this, go through the following sections of the [Chrome DevTools tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/):

- CSS
- Console
- DOM
- JavaScript

## 4. To regex, or not to regex (3 hrs)

Regex expressions are a powerful way to programmatically search and perform operations with text patterns. To become familiar with them, complete the [Regexone](http://regexone.com/) tutorial.

## 5. Time to dig into terminal (10 hrs)

Whether you’re working in a OS X, Unix, Linux or Windows (from version 10 upwards) environment, terminal is the main way programmers interact with the operating system.

Learn this powerful tool and understand how the command line works through the [Linux tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/).

## 6. Meet Git, your new friend (15 hrs)

Version control is a very important tool for every developer’s workflow, whether working in team or independently. Git is by far the most popular version control software in use today.

Make sure you understand why it’s used, and how it works.

For this section we’ll provide you with 3 resources:

- Do all the interactive lessons of the [Git-it app](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) (you can [download it here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases))
- Then go through “Getting Started”, “Collaborating”, and “Advanced Tips” of the [Atlassian Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/) docs
- Finally read chapters 1-3 of the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/) book

Once you’re done, start doing the exercises while you complete the remaining theory sections.

## 7. Intermediate JavaScript (16 hrs)

Complete [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) chapters 1-10.

In particular, make sure you understand these concepts well:

- Scope
- Inheritance
- Recursion
- Callbacks

## 8. Intermediate HTML and CSS (12 hrs)

For HTML, figure out the difference between a tag, an attribute, and a property.

For CSS, study the following topics:

- [Display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/display) and [position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/position) property
- The [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) model (check also “[a complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)”)
- [Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/transform) and [animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/animation)

## Extra credits

Once you have completed all the pre course curriculum, if you have free time left to study before joining the main course, continue your journey with these subjects:

- “Network”, “Storage”, “Mobile Simulation”, and “Performance” sections of the [Chrome DevTools tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
- Start taking a look at frameworks ([Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Koa](http://koajs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/)).
- Read through any topic of your interest at [superhero.js](http://superherojs.com/).
